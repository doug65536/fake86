Compilation and installation notes for Fake86 on Windows:

If you do not plan to look at or modify the source code, you can
just delete this archive and use the pre-compiled Win32 build of
Fake86 instead!

It is highly recommended that you use Visual Studio 2010 to compile
Fake86. The solution file is included in the "win32\" folder. You should
be able to compile with MinGW as well, but I have not tested it myself.
It will require some minor modifications, and a custom makefile.

Compiler requirements:
 - You will need libSDL 1.2.15 development library for Visual C++.
   You can download this from:
   http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-VC.zip

 - To enable ethernet emulation, you will also need to install the
   WinPCap library and developer's pack. This is available at:
   http://www.winpcap.org

 - Create a directory named "SDL" in your Visual C++ include path,
   and then copy the contents of the "SDL-1.2.15\include\" folder
   from that archive into it.

 - Next, copy the two ".lib" files from the "SDL-1.2.15\lib\x86\"
   folder in that archive into it. Also copy "SDL.dll" into the
   folder "fake86-version\win32\bin\" from this source archive.

This should allow you to compile successfully! After a successful
compile, the final Fake86.exe and Imagegen.exe files will be in
"fake86-version\win32\bin\". You will also need the files in "data\"
as well as "SDL.dll" to be in the same folder as "Fake86.exe" for
it to run properly.
