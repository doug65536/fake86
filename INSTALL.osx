For info on compiling for OS X, see the file INSTALL.linux as the instructions
are identical if you are compiling only for your native CPU.

If you would rather build a universal binary for OS X, the same instructions
should still be followed, except you need to add " -f makefile.osxuni " as an
option for all make commands.
